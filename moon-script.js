/**
 * Moon Page Script - Ultra-simplified Version 2
 * 
 * This JavaScript file was originally part of the moon page's interactive features.
 * In this version 2 downgrade, all functionality has been removed to create
 * an extremely simplified experience with minimal scripting.
 * 
 * Previous version likely contained:
 * - Moon phase animations and transitions
 * - Interactive elements for exploring moon features
 * - Parallax scrolling effects
 * - Dynamic content loading

    // All functional scripts and interactive elements have been removed
    // This serves as a placeholder for where functionality would be in version 3
